# Calendar Invitation Flow Implementation

## Problem
The original implementation had no way to properly handle invitations because:
1. A user who clicks an invitation link wasn't being authenticated
2. There was no redirection to the login page when required
3. After login, the user wasn't being redirected back to the shared calendar

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created a Dedicated Join Calendar Page
Created a new page at `/join-calendar/[id].js` that handles invitation links. This page:
- Checks if a user is logged in (has a token)
- If logged in, redirects them directly to the shared calendar
- If not logged in, redirects to the login page with a redirect parameter

### 2. Updated Login Flow to Handle Redirections
Modified the login form and page to:
- Detect when a user is coming from an invitation link
- Display a helpful notification message
- After successful login, redirect the user to the shared calendar they were invited to

### 3. Enhanced Shared Calendar Page
Updated the shared calendar page to:
- Check for authentication and redirect to login if needed
- Maintain the calendar ID during the authentication flow

### 4. Maintained the Invitation URL Structure
Kept the invitation URLs consistent, but with a proper redirection flow:
- Invitation email still sends links to `/join-calendar/{calendarId}`
- The join-calendar page handles the logic for redirecting to login when needed

## Flow Summary

1. User A invites User B to a calendar via email
2. User B receives email with link to `/join-calendar/{calendarId}`
3. User B clicks link and is redirected to the login page with a redirect parameter
4. User B logs in
5. User B is automatically redirected to the shared calendar page they were invited to

This ensures a smooth user experience while maintaining proper authentication.
